\begin{abstract}
  Cloud native applications add a layer of abstraction to the
underlying distributed computing system, creating an abstract,
self-scaling and self-managed architecture of different Microservices
linked by a messaging bus. Creating new algorithms that tap this
architectural patterns and at the same time they employ distributed
resources efficiently is a challenge we will be taking up in this
paper, that is why in this paper we propose KafkEO, a cloud native
framework that allows different implementations of evolutionary
algorithms and other population-based metaheuristics by using
micro-populations and stateless services as the main building
blocks. we introduce an open source implementation that uses OpenWhisk
as a serverless framework and Kafka as messaging hub. In this proof of
concept, we map the traditional evolutionary algorithm to this new
cloud-native format.  As far as we know, this is the first
architecture of this kind; the experiments show that resources are
used efficiently and that the cost to the cloud user is more
competitive, resulting in savings when compared against other cloud
implementations. We also perform an initial analysis of implementation
parameters that show their influence in performance.
