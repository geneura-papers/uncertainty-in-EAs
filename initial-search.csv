In this work, a new algorithm capable of generating technical rules to make investments with a given amount of leverage depending on the certainty of the prediction is presented. To forecast those predictions, a combination of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm – to identify and classify the market in three different stages – and a Dynamic Genetic Algorithm – to optimize trading rules in each type of market, is used. The optimization of the trading rules is based on several technical indicators. Forex data for the EUR/USD currency pair, in a timeframe between the years of 2003 and 2016, is used as training and test data. The proposed architecture for the machine learning system, as well as the implementation and study of the proposed system is described in detail. The use of an hybrid system, combining a SVM and a GA with dynamic approaches such as hyper-mutation and adaptability approaches by training three different GA's for each type of market, provide a new approach for FOREX trading, where it is possible to classify trends using price sequences and therefore using the same classification for optimizing investment strategies with the most appropriate GA.

A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to induce the sequence in which fitness measures should be applied over the GP generations. Subsequently, the performance of a GP system applying the evolved fitness measure sequence is compared with the conventional GP approach. The former approach is shown to significantly outperform standard GP on varied benchmark problems. Furthermore, the evolved fitness measure sequences are shown to generalize within a problem class: therefore, the sequences can be evolved off-line for different problem classes. Critically, sequences trained on the problem classes are also shown to generalize to complex, real-world problems. Overall, the findings of the study are in favor of the hypothesis.

First, we need to find not just one but as many optimal solutions as possible. Second, it demands a heavy computation to evaluate a candidate solution through a long series of underwater warfare simulations. The previous approach tried to reduce the amount of search by heuristically selecting a set of plausible starting points for the search by a simulated annealing algorithm. However, it shows only limited success and cannot easily scale up to larger problems. This paper proposes an efficient and easy-to-scale-up multimodal optimization algorithm named A-NTGA that is based on a genetic algorithm. A-NTGA quickly evaluates candidate solutions by conducting only a small number of simulations, but instead copes with these inaccurate or noisy fitness values by using a noisy optimization technique. To further enhance the efficiency of search by promoting the population diversity, A-NTGA is provided with an archive to which some good-looking solutions are migrated in order to prevent the population from being too crowded with similar solutions. Usually at the end of the search, many optimal solutions are retrieved from the archive as well as the population. The experimental results show that our method can find multiple optimal solutions more efficiently compared to other methods and can be easily scaled up to larger problems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028340688

Static FLA focuses on extracting the properties of a problem and does not consider any information about the optimization algorithms; thus, it is not adequate for indicating whether a particular algorithm is suitable for solving a problem. By contrast, dynamic FLA considers the behaviour of algorithms in combination with the properties of an optimization problem to determine the effectiveness of a given algorithm for solving that problem. However, previous dynamic FLA approaches are all individually based and lack statistical significance. In this paper, the concept of population evolvability is presented, as an extension of dynamic FLA, to quantify the effectiveness of population-based metaheuristic algorithms for solving a given problem. Specifically, two measures of population evolvability are defined that describe the probability that a population will obtain improved solutions to a problem and its ability to do so. Then, a combined measure is derived from these two measures to represent the overall population evolvability. Subsequently, the significance and validity of the proposed measures are investigated through analytical and experimental studies. Finally, the utility of the proposed measures is illustrated in an application of algorithm selection for black-box optimization problems. High accuracy in selecting the best algorithm is observed in a statistical analysis, with a low computational cost in terms of fitness evaluations. IEEE",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028536580

The local neighborhood fitness variance is here used to capture the noise distribution in the local surrounding of a candidate solution of the noisy optimization problem. The second strategy is concerned with determining the effective fitness estimate of a trial solution using the distribution of its noisy fitness samples, instead of direct averaging of the samples.

Here, we describe a predator-prey model in which the prey population growth depends on a prey density-dependent fitness landscape. We show that this two-species ecosystem is capable of exhibiting chaos even in the absence of external environmental variation or noise, and that the onset of chaotic dynamics is the result of the fitness landscape reversibly alternating between epochs of stabilizing and disruptive selection. We draw an analogy between the fitness function and the free energy in statistical mechanics, allowing us to use the physical theory of first-order phase transitions to understand the onset of rapid cycling in the chaotic predator-prey dynamics. We use quantitative techniques to study the relevance of our model to observational studies of complex ecosystems, finding that the evolution-driven chaotic dynamics confer community stability at the “edge of chaos” while creating a wide distribution of opportunities for speciation during epochs of disruptive selection—a potential observable signature of chaotic eco-evolutionary dynamics in experimental studies. © 2017 Gilpin, Feldman.",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026660892

Analyzing the fitness landscape is essential to understand the characteristics of DOPs and may provide guidance for the algorithm design. Existing measures for analyzing the dynamic fitness landscape, such as the dynamic fitness distance correlation and the severity of change, cannot give a comprehensive evaluation of the landscape and have many disadvantages. In this paper, we used Discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) and dynamic time warping (DTW) distance to acquire information of fitness landscape from frequency and time domains. Five measures are proposed, including the stationarity of amplitude change, the keenness, the periodicity, the change degree of average fitness and the similarity. They can reflect the features of fitness landscape from the aspects of outline, keenness, period, fitness value and similarity degree, respectively. These criteria can obtain essential information that cannot be acquired by existing criteria, and do not depend on the distribution of variables, the prior information of solutions and algorithms. To illustrate the performance of the five measures, experiments are conducted based on three types of standard DOPs with a two-peak function. In addition, we also apply these criteria on the test task scheduling problem for illustrating the fairness and adaptability. The experiment results show that these criteria can reflect the change characteristics of dynamic fitness landscape, and are consistent with the theoretical analysis. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007002636

The proposed HDE/MEBQ algorithm has the following two advantages when solving DOP. First and foremost, the HDE optimization framework can satisfy the problem requirement of different characteristics. DOP is actually a continuous process to solve different kinds of optimization problems to meet new requirements when the search environmental change occurs. Therefore, HDE/MEBQ is able to fastly respond to the environmental changes of DOP as the HDE framework uses multiple populations with heterogeneous parameters and operators to meet different search requirements in various search environments. Secondly, according to the phenomenon that most of the environmental changes may not be too drastic in real-world applications, historical information in the past may be useful for finding the optimum solution in the new environment. Thus, the MEBQ scheme used in HDE/MEBQ provides helpful historical evolutionary information from the elite ancestors for guiding individuals to evolve in a new environment strongly and to obtain faster convergence and a more precise solution. We evaluated HDE/MEBQ on several DOPs from CEC 2009 and compared with several state-of-the-art dynamic evolutionary algorithms.

From the user perspective, balancing trade-offs between energy consumption and users' comfort when scheduling home appliances is a challenging task mainly within dynamic context (energy price, budget, user preferences, energy source, etc). To address this challenge, this paper has modeled appliances scheduling as a dynamic constrained multi-objective optimization problem and have leveraged a recently introduced dynamic evolutionary algorithm for the problem resolution. Moreover, there are typically multiple inhabitants in the same home who often share context-aware applications with various individual preferences which are likely to be conflicting. We propose a new comfort function to support multi-user conflictual preferences.

MANET has characteristics of topology dynamics due to factors such as energy conservation and node movement that leads to dynamic load-balanced clustering problem (DLBCP). Load balancing and reliable data transfer between all the nodes are essential to prolong the lifetime of the network. MANET can also be partitioned into clusters for maintaining the network structure. Generally, clustering is used to reduce the size of the topology and to accumulate the topology information. It is necessary to have an effective clustering algorithm for adapting the topology change. In this, we used energy metric in Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the DLBCP. It is important to select the energy-efficient cluster head for maintaining the cluster structure and balance the load effectively. In this work, we used dynamic genetic algorithms such as Elitism-based Immigrants Genetic algorithm (EIGA) and Memory Enhanced Genetic Algorithm (MEGA) to solve DLBCP. These schemes select an optimal cluster head by considering the distance and energy parameters. We used EIGA to maintain the diversity level of the population and MEGA to store the old environments into the memory. It promises the energy efficiency of the entire cluster structure to increase the lifetime of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed schemes increases the network lifetime and reduces the total energy consumption.

Additionally, we prove that if migration occurs only rarely, denser migration topologies may be advantageous.

Any damage has the potential to disrupt the workings of the brain and cause seizures. These epileptic seizures are the manifestations of epilepsy. The electroencephalograph (EEG) signals register average neuronal activity from the cerebral cortex and label changes in activity over large areas. A detailed analysis of these electroencephalograph (EEG) signals provides valuable insights into the mechanisms instigating epileptic disorders. Moreover, the detection of interictal spikes and epileptic seizures in an EEG signal plays an important role in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Automatic seizure detection methods are required, as these epileptic seizures are volatile and unpredictable. This paper deals with an automated detection of epileptic seizures in EEG signals using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for feature extraction and proposes a novel genetic programming (GP) approach for classifying the EEG signals. Improvements in the standard GP approach are made using a Constructive Genetic Programming (CGP) in which constructive crossover and constructive subtree mutation operators are introduced. A hill climbing search is integrated in crossover and mutation operators to remove the destructive nature of these operators. A new concept of selecting the Globally Prime offspring is also presented to select the best fitness offspring generated during crossover. To decrease the time complexity of GP, a new dynamic fitness value computation (DFVC) is employed to increase the computational speed. We conducted five different sets of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in the classification of different mixtures of normal, interictal and ictal signals, and the accuracies achieved are outstandingly high.

In particular, for this setting it was shown that the (μ + 1)-EA on OneMax does not scale gracefully (higher noise cannot efficiently be compensated by higher μ). In this paper we want to understand whether there is anything special about the Gaussian distribution which makes the (μ + 1)-EA not scale gracefully. We keep the setting of posterior noise, but we look at other distributions. We see that for exponential tails the (μ + 1)-EA on OneMax does also not scale gracefully, for similar reasons as in the case of Gaussian noise.

That is a problem when optimizing a gameplaying engine: its fitness will be noisy, and if we use an evolutionary algorithm it will have to deal with it. This is not straightforward since there is an inherent uncertainty in the true value of the fitness of an individual, or rather whether one chromosome is better than another, thus making it preferable for selection. Several methods based on implicit or explicit average or changes in the selection of individuals for the next generation have been proposed in the past, but they involve a substantial redesign of the algorithm and the software used to solve the problem. In this paper we propose new methods based on incremental computation (memorybased) or fitness average or, additionally, using statistical tests to impose a partial order on the population; this partial order is considered to assign a fitness value to every individual which can be used straightforwardly in any selection function. Tests using several hard combinatorial optimization problems show that, despite an increased computation time with respect to the other methods, both memory-based methods have a higher success rate than implicit averaging methods that do not use memory; however, there is not a clear advantage in success rate or algorithmic terms of one method over the other. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949818091

Among these we find the absence of centralized updated information about all the variables, due to the spread out nature of the problems or lack of appropriate communications, or the dynamism of real-time operation. In fact, most optimization approaches assume that the problems they address are static, meaning that there is an optimal solution that does not change in time, but this is not always the case and there are problems that require following an optimum that changes in time. Distributed population-based techniques, such as swarms, have provided promising results in this context. They obtain a solution through the concurrent behavior of several adequately constructed processing elements. However, constructing these swarms is not straightforward, and most approaches have just mimicked swarm behaviors found in nature, adapting them to particular problems. The objective of this work is to study the application of a novel evolutionary paradigm, distributed Embodied Evolution (dEE), to obtain heterogeneous swarms that solve a set of realistic problems. In particular, we address here non-separable dynamic fitness landscapes, where interdependences between individuals imply that the contribution provided by one of them to the whole depends on the behavior of the others. This study is carried out applying a canonical version of dEE, which has been developed to generalize the main features of this type of evolutionary paradigm.

However, the slow convergence speed in the early iteration becomes the bottleneck to restrict the improvement of the FPO. In this paper, a modified dynamic virtual team for Fitness Predator Optimizer is proposed with the aim of accelerating the early convergence rate and improving the global searching capability for multimodal problems. The virtual dynamic team is a self-organization team that according to the nearest neighbour clustering. Each individual automatically is denoted as the team leader. The main function of the team leader is to obtain the neighbour team's best experience. It is worth noting that one of a team members may belong to another group concurrently. The expansion of individual best experience and the team best experience is carried out by this kind of multiple memberships. Consequently a paralleled exchanging information system is built on the modified dynamic virtual team to strengthen on the global searching capability during the early convergence process. Then an improved Dynamic Fitness Predator Optimizer (DFPO) with the modified virtual team is proposed in this paper. We extensively evaluated the DFPO and compared it with FPO, Dolphin Partner Optimization (DPO) and Standard Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO), with respect to both running time and global solution capability. Experimental results show that the proposed DFPO could demonstrate the desirable performance for multimodal problems. © 2015 IEEE.",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963544854

The proposed extension offers three merits with respect to its traditional counterpart. First, an adaptive selection of the sample size for the periodic fitness evaluation of a trial solution based on the fitness variance in its local neighborhood is proposed. This avoids the computational complexity associated with the unnecessary reevaluation of quality solutions without disregarding the necessary evaluations for relatively poor solutions to ensure accuracy in fitness estimates. The second strategy is concerned with determining the expected value of the noisy fitness samples on the basis of their distribution, instead of their conventional averaging, as the fitness measure of the trial solutions. Finally, a new crowding-distance-induced probabilistic selection criterion is devised to promote quality solutions from the same rank candidate pool to the next generation, ensuring the population quality and diversity in the objective spaces. Computer simulations performed on a noisy version of a well-known set of 23 benchmark functions reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms its competitors with respect to inverted generational distance, spacing, error ratio, and hypervolume ratio metrics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933515987

The EGM model attempts to improve the forecast accuracy and efficiency. The prediction error of the EGM model is minimized by applying a dynamic genetic algorithm (DGA). The contributions of the DGA are essentially from its two features: (1) the crossover and mutation rate controller of GA parameter optimization; and (2) the variable controller of EGM background value optimization.

The VRS based APSO algorithm (APSO/VRS) has the following two advantages when solving DOP. Firstly, by using the APSO optimizing framework, the algorithm benefits from the fast optimization speed due to the adaptive parameter control. More importantly, the adaptive parameter and operator in APSO make the algorithm fast respond to the environment changes of DOP. Secondly, VRS was reported in the literature to help dynamic evolutionary algorithm (DEA) to relocate the individual position in promising region when environment changes. Therefore, the modified VRS used in APSO can collect historical information in the stability stage and use such information to guide the particle variable relocation in the change stage.

We use the simulator of urban mobility (SUMO), a popular traffic simulator to generate traffic flows. A grid traffic network is designed with several scenarios to simulate changes of traffic flows captured by traffic monitors.

That is a problem when optimizing a game-playing engine: its fitness will be noisy, and if we use an evolutionary algorithm it will have to deal with it. This is not straightforward since there is an inherent uncertainty in the true value of the fitness of an individual, or rather whether one chromosome is better than another, thus making it preferable for selection. Several methods based on implicit or explicit average or changes in the selection of individuals for the next generation have been proposed in the past, but they involve a substantial redesign of the algorithm and the software used to solve the problem. In this paper we propose new methods based on incremental computation (memory-based) or fitness average or, additionally, using statistical tests to impose a partial order on the population; this partial order is considered to assign a fitness value to every individual which can be used straightforwardly in any selection function. Tests using several hard combinatorial optimization problems show that, despite an increased computation time with respect to the other methods, both memory-based methods have a higher success rate than implicit averaging methods that do not use memory; however, there is not a clear advantage in success rate or algorithmic terms of one method over the other.",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908679539

Unfortunately, the Web entities do not find enough motivation nor reward to do their part in the construction of a semantically richer Web environment. To enable a true semantic Web, each human-readable document should provide a formal knowledge repre-sentation for its content. As hand-crafted knowledge acquisition seems infeasible when applied to an environment as vast and dynamic as the Web, efforts have been focused on automatic approaches to extract semantic content from textual documents. Advances in Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction and Ontology Learning provided tools that allow for the extraction and analysis of structured semantic knowledge given existing textual corpus. While these tools seem promising to enable a scenario where Semantic Web can be achieved, they need to be adapted to the scale and complexity of the Web. In this article, I propose that a possible solution lies in harvesting the power of emergent multi-agent societies to create an infrastructure capable of bootstrapping the adoption of Semantic Web technologies. I focus on how to create and adapt distributed on-line evolutionary algorithms to continuously design and improve social agents capable of semantic knowledge retrieval. I argue that currently existing automatic and semi-automatic structured knowledge acquisition techniques can be adapted to serve not only as building blocks for emerging and evolving knowledge extracting processes but also as one of the driving forces behind its adaptation. I then claim that learning extracting procedures can be done not only using annotated resources but also existing techniques creating dynamic fitness models that can be continuously updated to improve the system.

There are two main ways to route the packets, i.e., unicast and multicast. In most cases, the unicast routing problem is to find the shortest path between two nodes in the network and the multicast routing problem is to find an optimal tree spanning the source and all the destinations. In recent years, both the shortest path routing and the multicast routing have been well addressed using intelligent optimization techniques. With the advancement in wireless communications, more and more mobile wireless networks appear, e.g., mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). One of the most important characteristics in MANETs is the topology dynamics, that is, the network topology changes over time due to energy conservation or node mobility. Therefore, both routing problems turn out to be dynamic optimization problems inMANETs. In this chapter, we investigate a series of dynamic genetic algorithms to solve both the dynamic shortest path routing problem and the dynamic multicast routing problem in MANETs.

As a result, the connectivity bits do not indicate the actual links but the probability of the existence of the connections, thus alleviating mapping problems and reducing the risk of throwing away a potential candidate. In addition, in the proposed model, each weight space is decomposed into subspaces in terms of quantum bits. Thus, the algorithm performs a region by region exploration, and evolves gradually to find promising subspaces for further exploitation. This is helpful to provide a set of appropriate weights when evolving the network structure and to alleviate the noisy fitness evaluation problem.

To achieve fairness and uniform energy consumption, each clusterhead should ideally support the same number of clustermembers. However, a MANET is a dynamic and complex system and its one important characteristic is the topology dynamics, that is, the network topology changes over time due to the factors such as energy conservation and node movement. Therefore, in a MANET, an effective clustering algorithm should efficiently adapt to each topology change and produce the new load balanced clusterhead set quickly. The maintenance of the cluster structure should aim to keep it as stable as possible to reduce overhead. To meet this requirement, the new solution should keep as many good parts in the previous solution as possible. In this paper, we first formulate the dynamic load balanced clustering problem (DLBCP) into a dynamic optimization problem. Then, we propose to use a series of dynamic genetic algorithms (GAs) to solve the DLBCP in MANETs. In these dynamic GAs, each individual represents a feasible clustering structure and its fitness is evaluated based on the load balance metric. Various dynamics handling techniques are introduced to help the population to deal with the topology changes and produce closely related solutions in good quality.

This game, which was chosen for the Google Artificial Intelligence Challenge in 2010, requires the bot to deal with multiple target planets, while achieving a certain degree of adaptability in order to defeat different opponents in different scenarios. The decision engine of the bot is initially based on a set of rules that have been defined after an empirical study, and a genetic algorithm (GA) is used for tuning the set of constants, weights and probabilities that those rules include, and therefore, the general behaviour of the bot. Then, the bot is supplied with the evolved decision engine and the results obtained when competing with other bots (a bot offered by Google as a sparring partner, and a scripted bot with a pre-established behaviour) are thoroughly analysed. The evaluation of the candidate solutions is based on the result of non-deterministic battles (and environmental interactions) against other bots, whose outcome depends on random draws as well as on the opponents' actions. Therefore, the proposed GA is dealing with a noisy fitness function. After analysing the effects of the noisy fitness, we conclude that tackling randomness via repeated combats and reevaluations reduces this effect and makes the GA a highly valuable approach for solving this problem. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870951132

Previous researchers have shown that this simultaneous evolution is a way to avoid the noisy fitness evaluation. The MA incorporates a crossover operator that shows to be useful for ameliorating the permutation problem of the network representation (i.e. different genotypes can be used to represent the same neural network phenotype), increasing the structural diversity of the individuals and improving the accuracy of the results. Instead of a recombination probability, the crossover operator considers a similarity parameter (the minimum structural distance), which allows to maintain a trade-off between global and local search. The neural network models selected in this work are the product-unit neural networks (PUNNs), due to their increasing relevance in those classification problems which show a high order relationship between the input variables. The proposed MA is intended to reduce the possible overtraining problems which can raise in some datasets for this kind of models. The evolutionary system is applied to eight classification benchmarks and the results of an analysis of variance contrast (ANOVA) show the effectiveness of the structural-based crossover operator and the capacity of our algorithm to obtain evolved PUNNs with a higher classification accuracy than those obtained using other evolutionary techniques. On the other hand, the results obtained are compared with popular effective machine learning classification methods, resulting in a competitive performance. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871429625

This algorithm has a compact structure and employs differential evolution search logic. Since it is a compact algorithm, it does not store a population of solutions but a probabilistic representation of the population. This kind of algorithmic structure can be implemented in those real-world problems characterized by memory limitations. The degree of randomization contained in the compact structure allows a robust behaviour in the presence of noise. In addition the proposed algorithm employs the noise analysis survivor selection scheme. This scheme performs an analysis of the noise and automatically performs a re-sampling of the solutions in order to ensure both reliable pairwise comparisons and a minimal cost in terms of fitness evaluations. The noise analysis component can be reliably used in noise environments affected by Gaussian noise which allow an a priori analysis of the noise features. This situation is typical of problems where the fitness is computed by means of measurement devices. An extensive comparative analysis including four different noise levels has been included. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm displays a very good performance since it regularly succeeds at handling diverse fitness landscapes characterized by diverse noise amplitudes. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861829870

Algorithms built with the proposed paradigm operate on a population of individuals that move in the search space as they interact and form groups. The interaction follows a set of social behaviours evolved by each group to enhance its adaptation to the environment (and other groups) and to achieve different desirable goals such as finding multiple optima, maintaining diversity, or tracking a moving peak in a changing environment. Each group has two sets of behaviours: one for intra-group interactions and one for inter-group interactions. These behaviours are evolved using mathematical models from the field of evolutionary game theory.

The proposed algorithm, namely noise analysis differential evolution (NADE), combines the stochastic properties of a randomised scale factor and a statistically rigorous test which supports one-to-one spawning survivor selection that automatically selects a proper sample size and then selects, among parent and offspring, the most promising solution. The actions of these components are separately analysed and their combined effect on the algorithmic performance is studied by means of a set of numerous and various test functions perturbed by Gaussian noise. Various noise amplitudes are considered in the result section. The performance of the NADE has been extensively compared with a classical algorithm and two modern metaheuristics designed for optimisation in the presence of noise. Numerical results show that the proposed NADE has very good performance with most of the problems considered in the benchmark set. The NADE seems to be able to detect high quality solutions despite the noise and display high performance in terms of robustness.

There were two challenges in that optimization process: first, the stochastic nature of the game results in a very noisy fitness function; second, the fitness function is computationally expensive. In this work we continue the optimization process for the heuristic strategy by optimizing the GA: for a fixed number of fitness function evaluations, we investigate the effects of varying the GA parameters (in particular the population size and number of generations), which in turn affect the number of samples per individual and thus noise as well. We also examine different sampling schedules; our schedules are unique in that selecting the final champion is considered a schedulable phase.

The proposed approach aims at solving highly multivariate and multi-modal landscapes which are also affected by a pernicious noise. The proposed algorithm employs a Differential Evolution framework and combines within this three additional algorithmic components. A controlled randomization of scale factor and crossover rate are employed which should better handle uncertainties of the problem and generally enhance performance of the Differential Evolution. Two combined local search algorithms applied to the scale factor, during offspring generation, should enhance performance of the Differential Evolution framework in the case of multi-modal and high dimensional problems. An on-line statistical test aims at assuring that only strictly necessary samples are taken and that all pairwise selections are properly performed. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a various set of test problems and its behavior has been studied, dependent on the dimensionality and noise level. A comparative analysis with a standard Differential Evolution, a modern version of Differential Evolution employing randomization of the control parameters and four metaheuristics tailored to optimization in a noisy environment has been carried out. One of these metaheuristics is a classical algorithm for noisy optimization while the other three are modern Differential Evolution based algorithms for noisy optimization which well represent the state-of-the-art in the field.

The increasing user demands for various multimedia data make VOD (Video-on-Demand) services to be developed. VOD services are being used in lots of fields, such as entertainment, distance learning, home shopping, and interactive news. In comparison to the existing HTTP services, these VOD services have special features that the time for their services is longer and the services request more disks and network bandwidths. Therefore, compared to HTTP service environments, VOD services have some different workload patterns. In these VOD service environments, the existing load balancing algorithms researched before are not proper. In this paper, we propose a new load balancing algorithm that is based on the history of past user access patterns to make server loads even on hierarchically distributed VOD system environments. This algorithm uses a dynamic genetic algorithm. The proposed distributed VOD system environment consists of a number of VOD servers, which are distributed geographically, and control servers that manage each group of VOD servers. User requests are distributed to prevent convergence by distributing VOD servers geographically. We use a genetic algorithm based on history data to distribute user requests in a local service area.

It has reportedly outperformed many types of evolutionary algorithms and other search heuristics when tested over both benchmark and real-world problems. However the performance of most search heuristics deteriorates severely when applied to the task of optimization of noisy landscapes. This paper presents an improved IWO algorithm to effectively find the global optima of noisy functions. This is achieved by using an increased value of standard deviation, changing the manner of its reduction to linear and by employing a novel selection strategy which varies from the one use in the standard IWO. An extensive performance comparison of the newly proposed scheme, the original DE (DE/Rand/1/Exp), the canonical PSO, standard real-coded EA, and DE-RSF-TS has been presented using well-known benchmarks corrupted by zero-mean Gaussian noise.

A significant number of these uncertainty problems falls into the dynamic optimization category in which the fitness function varies through time. For this class of problems, an evolutionary algorithm is expected to perform satisfactorily in spite of different degrees and frequencies of change in the fitness landscape. In addition, the dynamic evolutionary algorithm should warrant an acceptable performance improvement to justify the additional computational cost. Effective reuse of previous evolutionary information is a must as it facilitates a faster convergence after a change has occurred. This paper proposes a new dynamic evolutionary algorithm that uses variable relocation to adapt already converged or currently evolving individuals to the new environmental condition. The proposed algorithm relocates those individuals based on their change in function value due to the change in the environment and the average sensitivities of their decision variables to the corresponding change in the objective space. The relocation occurs during the transient stage of the evolutionary process, and the algorithm reuses as much information as possible from the previous evolutionary history. As a result, the algorithm shows improved adaptation and convergence. The newly adapted population is shown to be fitter to the new environment than the original or most randomly generated population. The algorithm has been tested by several dynamic benchmark problems and has shown competitive results compared to some chosen state-of-the-art dynamic evolutionary approaches. © 2009 IEEE.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67650114632

Many of the existing methods for segmenting a multi-component image (satellite or aerial) are very slow and require a priori knowledge of the image that could be difficult to obtain.

Recently, fuzzy C-means (FCM) and Genetic Algorithms were separately used in segmenting multi-component images but neither of them had successfully addressed the above concerns. GA was enhanced using Hill-climbing, randomising, and modified mutation operators, leading to what is called hybrid dynamic genetic algorithm (HDGA).

However, many real life optimization problems involve time-variant noisy environment, which pose major challenges to EA-based optimization. Presence of noise interferes with the evaluation and the selection process of EA and adversely affects the performance of the algorithm[6]. Also presence of noise means fitness function can not be evaluated and it has to be estimated instead. Several approaches have been tried to overcome this problem, such as introduction of diversity (hyper mutation, random immigrants, special operators) or incorporation of memory of the past (diploidy, case based memory)[5]. In this paper we propose a method, DPGA (distributed population genetic algorithm) that uses a distributed population based architecture to simulate a distributed, self-adaptive memory of the solution space. Local regression is used in each sub-population to estimate the fitness. Specific problem category considered is that of optimization of functions with time variant noisy fitness.

For this class of problems, an evolutionary algorithm is expected to perform well under different levels and frequencies of change in the landscape. In addition, the dynamic evolutionary algorithm should warrant an acceptable performance improvement to justify the additional computational cost. Effective reuse of previous evolutionary information is a must as it facilitates a faster convergence after a change has occurred. This paper introduces a new dynamic evolutionary algorithm that uses variable relocation vectors to adapt already converged or currently evolving individuals to the new environmental condition. The proposed algorithm relocates those individuals based on their change in functional value due to the change in the environment and the average sensitivities of their decision variables to the corresponding change in the objective space.

Use of a population based iterative technique like evolutionary algorithms in such problem domains is thus practically prohibitive. An attractive alternative is to build surrogates or use an approximation of the actual fitness functions to be evaluated. Many regression and interpolation tools are available to build such meta models. This paper briefly discusses the architectures and use of such meta-modeling tools in an evolutionary optimization context. We further present an evolutionary algorithm framework which involves use of surrogate models for fitness function evaluation. The original framework namely, the Dynamic Approximate Fitness based Hybrid EA (DAFHEA) model [14] reduces computation time by controlled use of meta-models (in this case approximate model generated by Support Vector Machine regression) to partially replace the actual function evaluation by approximate function evaluation. However, the underlying assumption in DAFHEA is that the training samples for the meta-model are generated from a single uniform model. This does not take into account uncertain scenarios involving noisy fitness functions. The enhanced model, DAFHEA-II, incorporates a multiple-model based learning approach for the support vector machine approximator to counter effects of noise [15].

This, in turn, could revolutionize detection, treatment, and in some cases prevention of disease. While genes for most of the rare monogenic diseases have already been discovered, most common diseases are complex traits, resulting from multiple gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Detecting epistatic genetic interactions that predispose for disease is an important, but computationally daunting, task currently facing bioinformaticists. Here, we propose a new evolutionary approach that attempts to hill-climb from large sets of candidate epistatic genetic features to smaller sets, inspired by Kauffman's ""random chemistry"" approach to detecting small auto-catalytic sets of molecules from within large sets. Although the algorithm is conceptually straightforward, its success hinges upon the creation of a fitness function able to discriminate large sets that contain subsets of interacting genetic features from those that don't. Here, we employ an approximate and noisy fitness function based on the ReliefF data mining algorithm. We establish proof-of-concept using synthetic data sets, where individual features have no marginal effects. We show that the resulting algorithm can successfully detect epistatic pairs from up to 1,000 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms in time that is linear in the size of the initial set, although success rate degrades as heritability declines. Research continues into seeking a more accurate fitness approximator for large sets and other algorithmic improvements that will enable us to extend the approach to larger data sets and to lower heritabilities. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36148957819

We present a mechanism of FS, i.e., dynamic fitness sharing, which has been devised in order to overcome these limitations. The proposed method allows an explicit, dynamic identification of the species discovered at each generation, their localization on the fitness landscape, the application of the sharing mechanism to each species separately, and a species elitist strategy.

On financial optimization problems, Monte-Carlo method is commonly used to evaluate the optimization criteria such as value at risk. The evaluation model is often very complex which needs considerable computational overheads. In order to realize efficient optimization of financial problems, we propose a method to decide the number of samples used to estimate the optimization criteria. Selection efficiency proposed in this paper is a index that shows how close the population approaches to the convergence to a good solution. In general, it is difficult to calculate selection efficiency analytically. Thus we also employ bootstrap method to estimate selection efficiency. The resulting algorithm is applied to the optimization of the procurement plan optimization problem. The result shows that Value at Risk of the problem is optimized efficiently by the proposed method. © 2006 IEEE.",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547257866

On a linear fitness function, if intermediate multi-recombination is applied on the object parameters, the i-th best and the i-th worst individual have the same ω-distribution.

Optimized process parameters include both machining parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut) and production parameters (material order size and inventory safety stock and reorder point). In high-volume production, machining parameters have amplified impacts on the machine performance in terms of productivity (cycle time), reliability (tool life), and product quality (surface finish). In addition, production parameters become critical in high-volume production since they directly impact the overall order fulfillment (production makespan and delivery reliability). Hence, this paper extends the conventional per-part machining cost model into a per-order production cost model by consolidating the production economics of both machining parameters and production controls. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is utilized to capture the stochastic and dynamic production attributes and to transfer the static machine PD model into a dynamic PD-DES production model. The model is also utilized to accumulate the per-order running cost over production time while incorporating the impacts of process variability in tool life, labor efficiency, machining conditions, order lead time, and demand rate. Using the PD-DES model as a dynamic fitness function, a Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) is developed and applied to a CNC lathe machine to determine near-optimal settings to both machining and production process parameters so that the overall per-order production cost is minimized. Results showed effective SGA convergence profile with relatively low number of search generations. Sensitivity analysis with SGA parameters is conducted to demonstrate the search's robustness. The benefits of the per-order cost model are illustrated by repeating the SGA solution using machine productivity as a fitness criterion. The new SGA solution resulted in a better productivity but at a higher per-order cost. Finally, the effectiveness of SGA search is illustrated by outperforming the solutions obtained from two-level and three-level full factorial designs. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

There are two classes of problem for which this formulation is insufficient. The first consists of ongoing searches for better solutions in a nonstationary environment in which the expected fitness of a solution changes with time in unpredictable ways. The second class consists of applications in which fitness evaluations are corrupted by noise. For problems belonging to either or both of these classes, the estimated fitness of a solution will have an associated uncertainty. Both the uncertainty due to environmental changes (process noise) and the uncertainty due to noisy evaluations (observation noise) can be reduced, at least temporarily, by re-evaluating existing solutions. The Kalman formulation provides a well-developed formal mechanism for treating uncertainty within the GA framework. It provides the mechanics for determining the estimated fitness and uncertainty when a new solution is generated and evaluated for the first time. It also provides the mechanics for updating the estimated fitness and uncertainty after an existing solution is re-evaluated and for increasing the uncertainty with the passage of time. A Kalman-extended genetic algorithm (KGA) is developed to determine when to generate a new individual, when to re-evaluate an existing individual, and which one to re-evaluate. This KGA is applied to the problem of maintaining a network configuration with minimized message loss in which the nodes are mobile and the transmission over a link is stochastic. As the nodes move, the optimal network changes, but information contained within the population of solutions allows efficient discovery of better-adapted solutions. The ability of the KGA to continually find near-optimal solutions is demonstrated at several levels of process and observation noise. The sensitivity of the KGA performance to several control parameters is explored.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035247711

This technique that may be called ""Mutate large, but inherit small"", is discussed in light of the EPP (evolutionary progress principle). The derivation of the progress rate formula is sketched, its predictions are compared with experiments, and its limitations are shown. The dynamical behavior of the ES is investigated. It will be shown that standard self-adaptation has considerable problems to drive the ES in its optimum working regime. Remedies are provided to improve the self-adaptation.",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-22444453417

In simulations noise is mostly restricted to the finite precision of the numbers and can often be neglected. However in biology fluctuations are ubiquitous and also in real world applications, where evolutionary methods are used as optimization tools, the presence of noise has to be coped with [1]. This article originated from the second point: Optimizing the structure of Neural Networks their fitness is the result of a learning process. This value depends on the stochastic initialization of the connection strengths and thus represents a noisy fitness value. To reduce noise one can average over several evaluations per individual which is costly. The aim of this work is to introduce a method to reduce the number of evaluations per individual.",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878524995

In this paper, a linguistic (qualitative) modeling approach is proposed. The approach combines the merits of the fuzzy logic theory, neural networks, and genetic algorithms (GA's). The proposed model is presented in a fuzzy-neural network (FNN) form which can handle both quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (linguistic) knowledge. The learning algorithm of an FNN is composed of three phases. The first phase is used to find the initial membership functions of the fuzzy model. In the second phase, a new algorithm is developed and used to extract the linguistic-fuzzy rules. In the third phase, a multiresolutional dynamic genetic algorithm (MRD-GA) is proposed and used for optimized tuning of membership functions of the proposed model. Two well-known benchmarks are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed modeling approach, and compare it with other modeling approaches. © 1998 IEEE.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032164764

We employ the genetic code for the analysis, because the robustness and changeability are defined quantitatively as the intrinsic properties of the structure of genetic codes. Specifically, we study the relationship between the variability of the fitness landscape and the robustness and changeability of genetic codes. Genetic algorithm was applied to obtain genetic codes suitable for a given variability of fitness landscapes, where a multimodal function defines a dynamic fitness landscape, varying constantly the number and the height of peaks. For higher variable fitness landscapes, genetic codes with lower robustness are obtained. The dynamic control of the robustness and changeability of genetic codes is also discussed.",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032313098

The second is a general relationship between the crossover and mutation rates that are most useful for a dynamic fitness function with a specific rate of change in Hamming distance, and that could possibly provide insight into the utility of the standard GA approach for the optimization of dynamic landscapes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947786473

A genetic algorithm is used to simulate evolution processes, and thereby to develop neural network control systems that exhibit specialist or generalist behaviors according to the fitness formula. With evolvable fitness formulae the evaluation measure is let free to evolve, and we obtain a co-evolution of the expressed behavior and the individual evolvable fitness formula. The use of evolvable fitness formulae lets us work in a dynamic fitness landscape, opposed to most work, that traditionally applies to static fitness landscapes, only. The role of competition in specialization is studied by letting the individuals live under social conditions in the same, shared environment and directly compete with each other. We find, that competition can act to provide population diversification in populations of organisms with individual evolvable fitness formulae. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1995.",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957794740

They are similar to genetic algorithms but work in continuous spaces and have the additional capability of self-adapting their major strategy parameters. This paper presents the most important features of ESs, namely their self-adaptation, as well as their robustness and potential for parallelization which they share with other evolutionary algorithms. Besides the early (1 + 1)-ES and its underlying theoretical results, the modern (μ + λ)-ES and (μ, λ)-ES are presented with special emphasis on the self-adaptation of strategy parameters, a mechanism which enables the algorithm to evolve not only the object variables but also the characteristics of the probability distributions of normally distributed mutations. The self-adaptation property of the algorithm is also illustrated by an experimental example. The robustness of ESs is demonstrated for noisy fitness evaluations and by its application to discrete optimization problems, namely the travelling salesman problem (TSP). Finally, the paper concludes by summarizing existing work and general possibilities regarding the parallelization of evolution strategies and evolutionary algorithms in general. © 1994 Chapman & Hall.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0039142650
